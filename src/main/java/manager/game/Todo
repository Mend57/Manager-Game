-Implement Market

    implement buy and sell players on class Team
        - check for players for x position if needed
        - buy the best one for a decent price

        - check for unnecessary player in x position
        - if unnecessary put for sale
        - price will depend on:
            if the player is not that unnecessary
            quality of player
            a bit of randomness
        if sold player is transferred to the new team during the next transfer window
        if player has no team or is sold during transfer window it goes immediately

        if the contract expires player exit the team and goes to the market with no fees attached


- players registration for the league
    registration ends with transfer window

-team will get budget during the transfer window

- implement training
    after 1 month in that training roll a dice every day to see if the attribute is improved
    dice chance is if random <= dice chance = 0.02174
    after 3 months rolling the dice or 4 months total upgrade the attribute if not upgraded yet
    after upgrade reset the training


- if player is not controlling the team can change team formation after 2 months with a dice roll every month

-look for birthdays everyday
-every year after 24 stamina debuff increases by 1

-retirement
    after x age rolls a 0.2 dice every season to see if it will retire
     if decides to retire will not renovate contract
     remove player from the game

-every season creates new players with random stats
    new players start at 16 and can be already bought, for less than a normal player, but they cant play it in leagues

-player decides if it will renovate contract based mostly on money from other offers, but also team prestige and overall quality

- finish calendar adding every task that we need to do daily, weekly or in any given time
