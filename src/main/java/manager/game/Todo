-Implement Market

    implement buy and sell players on class Team
        - check for players for x position if needed
        - buy the best one for a decent price

        - check for unnecessary player in x position
        - if unnecessary put for sale
        - price will depend on:
            if the player is not that unnecessary
            quality of player
            a bit of randomness
        if sold player is transferred to the new team during the next transfer window
        if player has no team or is sold during transfer window it goes immediately

        if the contract expires player exit the team and goes to the market with no fees attached


- players registration for the league
    registration ends with transfer window

-team will get budget during the transfer window

- implement training
    after 1 month in that training roll a dice every day to see if the attribute is improved
    dice chance is if random <= dice chance = 0.02174
    after 3 months rolling the dice or 4 months total upgrade the attribute if not upgraded yet
    after upgrade reset the training

-everyday checks if player contract is about to end, send a notification with 6 months, 3 months, 1 month a week and a day before

-remove player from database after retirement

-player decides if it will renovate contract based mostly on money from other offers, but also team prestige and overall quality

- finish calendar adding every task that we need to do daily, weekly or in any given time

-calculate player estimated price in Player

-rework of formation familiarity, take it out from Team and add to Player, then calculate Team formation familiarity based on players



- finish calendar and every unfinished method throughout the codebase(probably unfinished because it depends on the db)
